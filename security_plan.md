# Security Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures and implementation strategies for the appointment booking system. The plan covers authentication, authorization, data protection, network security, and other critical security aspects.

## Authentication Security

### Password Security
- **Hashing Algorithm**: Use bcrypt with a minimum of 12 rounds for password hashing
- **Password Policies**:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Require at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character
  - Password expiration every 90 days
  - Prevent reuse of last 5 passwords
- **Storage**: Never store plain text passwords; only store bcrypt hashes

### JSON Web Token (JWT) Security
- **Token Generation**: Use cryptographically secure random generators for token creation
- **Signing Algorithm**: Use RS256 (asymmetric) or HS256 (symmetric) with strong secrets
- **Token Expiration**:
  - Access tokens: 15 minutes
  - Refresh tokens: 7 days
- **Token Storage**:
  - Access tokens: HTTP-only, secure cookies or local storage (with XSS protection)
  - Refresh tokens: HTTP-only, secure, same-site cookies
- **Token Revocation**: Maintain a blacklist of revoked tokens for logout functionality

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Optional MFA**: Offer TOTP-based 2FA for users who want additional security
- **Recovery Codes**: Generate and securely store backup codes for MFA recovery
- **Device Trust**: Allow users to mark devices as trusted to reduce MFA prompts

## Authorization Security

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Roles**: Admin and Fan with clearly defined permissions
- **Permission Checks**: Implement both frontend and backend authorization checks
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have access to resources they need
- **Role Assignment**: Roles assigned during registration and can only be changed by administrators

### Session Management
- **Secure Session IDs**: Use cryptographically secure random values for session IDs
- **Session Timeout**: Implement both idle timeout (30 minutes) and absolute timeout (8 hours)
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Limit concurrent sessions per user (default: 5)
- **Session Regeneration**: Regenerate session IDs after login and privilege changes

## Data Protection

### Data Encryption
- **At-Rest Encryption**: Use PostgreSQL's built-in encryption for sensitive data
- **In-Transit Encryption**: Enforce HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Encrypt PII (Personally Identifiable Information) like phone numbers
- **Key Management**: Use environment variables for encryption keys, rotate regularly

### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Server-Side Validation**: Validate all inputs on the server side
- **Client-Side Validation**: Implement for user experience but never rely solely
- **Whitelist Validation**: Use allowlists for known good values where possible
- **Sanitization**: Sanitize user inputs before displaying or storing

### SQL Injection Prevention
- **Parameterized Queries**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM or parameterized raw queries
- **Input Escaping**: Automatically escape special characters in user inputs
- **Least Privilege Database Users**: Database user accounts have minimal required permissions
- **Stored Procedures**: Use stored procedures for complex database operations

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
- **Output Encoding**: Encode data before rendering in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and URLs
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement strict CSP headers
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize user inputs that will be displayed
- **Template Escaping**: Use auto-escaping templates (Jinja2)

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention
- **CSRF Tokens**: Implement synchronizer tokens for state-changing operations
- **SameSite Cookies**: Set SameSite attribute on cookies
- **Referer Checking**: Validate referer header for sensitive operations
- **Custom Headers**: Require custom headers for AJAX requests

## Network Security

### HTTPS Implementation
- **TLS Configuration**: Use TLS 1.2 or higher with strong cipher suites
- **Certificate Management**: Use Let's Encrypt or commercial certificates
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforce HTTPS with HSTS headers
- **Certificate Pinning**: Implement certificate pinning for mobile apps

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (100 requests/hour per user)
- **API Keys**: Use API keys for server-to-server communication
- **Request Validation**: Validate all API requests for proper headers and content types
- **Versioning**: Implement API versioning to manage changes securely

### Firewall and Network Configuration
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrict access to only necessary ports (80, 443, 22)
- **Database Isolation**: Keep database servers on private networks
- **Load Balancer Security**: Use load balancers with WAF capabilities
- **DDoS Protection**: Implement DDoS protection measures

## Application Security

### Secure Coding Practices
- **Error Handling**: Never expose stack traces or system information in error messages
- **Logging**: Log security events without exposing sensitive data
- **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Code Reviews**: Implement mandatory code reviews for security-sensitive code

### Security Headers
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevent MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevent clickjacking
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enable XSS protection in browsers
- **Referrer-Policy**: Control referrer information
- **Feature-Policy**: Restrict browser features

### File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Restrict allowed file types
- **File Size Limits**: Implement reasonable file size limits
- **Virus Scanning**: Scan uploaded files for malware
- **Secure Storage**: Store uploaded files outside the web root

## User Privacy

### Data Minimization
- **Collect Only Necessary Data**: Only collect data required for functionality
- **Data Retention**: Implement data retention policies (e.g., delete inactive accounts after 2 years)
- **Data Portability**: Allow users to export their data
- **Right to Erasure**: Implement functionality to delete user data upon request

### Privacy by Design
- **Privacy Settings**: Provide granular privacy controls
- **Data Anonymization**: Anonymize data used for analytics
- **Third-Party Sharing**: Clearly disclose any third-party data sharing
- **Privacy Policy**: Maintain an up-to-date privacy policy
